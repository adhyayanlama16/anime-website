            <p class="SectionDescription"> Anime is a Japanese hand-drawn or computer animation. <br>
                The word abbreviated pronunciation "animation" in Japanese where this terms references all animation. 
                Outside Japan, anime is used to refer specifically to animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters, and fantastical themes. <br>
                Arguable, the culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. 
                For simplicity, many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product. Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of orientalism.  </p>
